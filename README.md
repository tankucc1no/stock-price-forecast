# Stock-price-forecast
Use Linear Regression to Forecast Stock Prices.  
This is a basic model that requires manual addition of different parameters and features to compare the two models.
# Goals
Use “Stock Exchange Data” to train the multiple linear regression model and the ridge regression model, and forecast the next day's closing price for a single stock.

# Dataset
Stock Exchange Data is from Yahoo and provided by Kaggle. In this research, I will use the stock in the dataset with the ticker Symbol “HSI".

# How to use
Use jupyter notebook to run the code.  
This file contains two basic models. Multiple Linear Regression and Ridge Regression.  
By comparing the results produced by different models, you will be able to analyze the differences between different models.
## Multiple Linear Regression
Predict stock prices using raw data.
## Ridge Regression
Some modifications have been made to the raw data. Train the model with the newly generated data.
